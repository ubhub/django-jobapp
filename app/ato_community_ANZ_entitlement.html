Hi @ub268



Our tech team has come through with advice about how you'd treat mum's shares.



The renounceable ANZ Entitlement Offer was for existing shareholders to subscribe for 1 ANZ share at $18.90 for every 15 ANZ shares held at Record Date.  Your mum received a cash payment of $4 for every 15 ANZ shares she held. The cash payment, also known as a retail premium, is capital gain. For more information on why the retail premium is capital gain and retail premium go to TR2017/4 and Taxing retail premium (QC 21832) respectively.



You advised mum’s ANZ shares comprised of pre and post 1985 purchases. You need to separate mum’s ANZ shares into pre and post 1985 shares as under s 130-45, the entitlements were acquired at the time when the original shares were acquired. Accordingly, the entitlements payment that attached to the pre 1985 shares do not attract capital gain tax. The entitlements payment that attached to the post 1985 may be eligible for a capital gain discount if mum satisfies the criteria set out in CGT discount.
